About the Dataset

This dataset has 9 CSV files elaborating the details of E-commerce.

The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to latitude/longitude coordinates.

All text identifying stores and partners were replaced by the names of Game of Thrones houses for maintaining anonymity.
